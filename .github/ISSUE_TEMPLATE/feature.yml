                Thank you for expressing your interest in a new Firmament feature.
                Please keep in mind that not every feature is a good fit for Firmament,
                *especially* if there is already another mod for Firmaments versions
                which covers that feature very well. It doesn't hurt to ask, but please
                understand that even features I want to implement, might take some time
                to be fully realized.
                
                Before creating a feature request, please check if the feature complies
                with [Hypixel rules](https://hypixel.net/skyblock-rules).
